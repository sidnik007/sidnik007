Hello visitor, I’m Siddhesh Nikude. I am a Software Craftsperson / Extreme Programmer by heart and co-founder of Nelkinda Software Craft. 
Together with my co-founder [Christian Hujer](https://github.com/christianhujer) we raise the bar of professional software development by doing it and 
showing others how to do it. We continue to help a lot of companies improve and fix their codebase and process. Here is a quick list of what I can help with

- Full-stack Agile coaching (from process to coding)
- Extreme Programming practices
- Events like Meetups and Coderetreats (free if it is for community) 
..
